## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![model summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100237685/183472292-e3215cc8-605e-4da1-994b-9bcd48a54554.png)


1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- The AWD, vehicle_weight, and spoiler_angle provided an non-random amount of variance.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- The slope is not considered to be zero because we rejected the null hypothesis as our p-value was less than 0.05. 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- If the limited variables provided are all the company is looking for to predict the mpg of the prototypes then yes, the model predicts it effectively at ~71.5% success rate. There are other elements that can affect the mpg of a car, so the company might want to consider expanding the number of variables.
